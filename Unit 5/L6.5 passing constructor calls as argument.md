## passing constructor calls as argument
#### methods that take objects as parameters
- it's not uncommon for methods to ask for an object as a parameter, as in the following example:
```java
public static void doStuff(Puppy dog1)
```
- to call this method, we might do something like the following:
```java
Puppy myDog = new Puppy("Alph");
doStuff(myDog);
```
- however the following is also an option
```java
doStuff(new Puppy("Alph"));
```
- in the 2nd version, you are constructing the Puppy object and promptly passing it into the method call (as `dog1`)
- notice that these two versions do __not__ do the exact same thing. IN the second version, after the doStuff method terminates, we don't have a variable to access the object with, so it will probably be destroyed by the automatic garbage collector
