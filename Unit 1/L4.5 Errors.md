## 8/24/21 - Errors
### run time vs compile-time
#### compile-time vs run-time errors
- compile-time
	- we classify errors depending on when they become apparent: when the code compiles, or when the code runs
	- compile-time errors are caught by the compiler before the program runs.  the compiler is only really able to detect errors that are the result of you typing something that doesn't make sense in Java, so we also call these syntax errors
 - run-time errors
	 - run-time errors are caught when the program runs. since the compiler has already caught syntax errors by then, the only possible errors are caused by writing a program that doesn't make sense, so these are also called logic errors
	 - very serious run-time errors cause the program to crash and terminate with an Exception. Most run-time errors just make the program do something different from what you intended.
		 - bugs!
